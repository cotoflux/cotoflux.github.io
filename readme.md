Porfolio Git: This project is to work further in my skills and present my different repos as Portfolio.

Right now I am focused in learning FullStack Developement and mainly work in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP, althought I keep up to date with my Java and Android knowledge.

Because I am active studing in Web development I also Hackaton projects, Volunteer in Codebar.io, in Footprint, in Homeless Entepreneur and Factoria F5,... sometimes I am not stictly updating as regularly as I would like. 

I am fluent in 4 languages (English, French, Spanish and Catalan) so you will see my Front is in Spanish and my back in English. 

If you need any asistance please contact me i will be more than glad to help you.

Regards,
